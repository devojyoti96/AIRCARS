AIRCARS : Automated Imaging Routine for the Compact Arrays for the Radio Sun

AIRCARS is an automated Stokes I calibration and imaging pipeline for spectroscopic snapshot imaging with solar observations made using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

If you use this pipeline, cite Mondal et al 2019 ApJ 875 97, https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0a01 

AIRCARS works only with CASA version 4.6

Remember to change the spw input both in the selfcal_input.py and imaging_scheduler.py.
Remember to change the max_baseline parameter depending on the array you are dealing with.
Remember to change the array name in selfcal_input.py
